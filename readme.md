## Scripts I've collected for loading datasets

### load_wiki

Loads "cleaned" wikipedia data described at http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata
as a list of words. "Cleaned" data uses only the 26 lowercase English
characters.

Data comes in two flavors:
- text9: first 10^9 bytes of 2006 English Wikipedia dump (124 million words)
- text8: first 10^8 bytes of the same dump (17 million words)

This code was adapted from step 1 of Google's word2vec tutorial available at:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.8/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py

```python
from load_datasets import load_wiki
text8 = load_wiki.load_text8(target_dir="data")
text9 = load_wiki.load_text9(target_dir="data")
```

### load_mnist

Loads MNIST training, validation and test datasets as objects with the following
properties/methods:

- images
- labels
- num_examples
- epochs_completed
- next_batch(batch_size, fake_data=False)

This code is written by Google and is available at: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r0.7/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/input_data.py

```python
from load_datasets import load_mnist
mnist = load_mnist.read_data_sets(target_dir="data")

mnist_train = mnist.train
mnist_val = mnist.validation
mnist_test = mnist.test
```
